## Build process

### Map design
I first chose a tile set from [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets), then I downloaded [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), a level editor and I drew a map that I liked.

### Classes
The only two classes I needed in this game were the `spred` class and the `boundary` class. -->
